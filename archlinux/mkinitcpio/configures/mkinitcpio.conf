# Defines an array of additional modules which should be added to the image.
#
# Dependencies (including other modules and necessary firmware), will also be 
# added to the image. At runtime, the modules in this array which were 
# successfully added to the image will be explicitly loaded.
MODULES=()

# Defines an array of additional files which should be added to the image. 
#
# Files are added as is, and parent directories will be added if needed. Files 
# specified in this variable will override previously added files of the same 
# path.
FILES=()

# Defines an array of additional binaries which should be added to the image. 
# 
# These are assumed to be dynamic ELF binaries, and necessary shared library 
# dependencies will automatically be added. However, it is not considered an 
# error to specify a non-ELF binary in this variable. Parent directories will be
# added if needed. Files specified in this variable will override previously 
# added files of the same path.
BINARIES=()

# Defines an array of hooks which will be run during the build process. 
#
# Order is important, as it defines the order in which hooks will be run during
# bootup. Use mkinitcpioâ€™s -L flag to list all available hooks, and the -H flag
# to display the help text for a specific hook.
HOOKS=()

# Defines a program to filter the generated image through. 
#
# The kernel understands the compression formats yielded by the zstd, gzip, 
# bzip2, lz4, lzop, lzma, and xz compressors. If unspecified, this setting 
# defaults to zstd compression. In order to create an uncompressed image, 
# define this variable as cat.
COMPRESSION=()

# Defines an array of additional options to be passed to the compression program. 
#
# This option is generally not used. It can be potentially dangerous and may 
# cause invalid images to be generated without any sign of an error.
COMPRESSION_OPTIONS=()
