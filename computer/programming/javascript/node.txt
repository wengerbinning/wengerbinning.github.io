Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser.


A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.

Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that
prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms,
making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
