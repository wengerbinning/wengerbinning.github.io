npm is the world's largest software registry.

Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages,
and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.


npm consists of three distinct components:

* the website
* the Command Line Interface (CLI)
* the registry



```shell
npm config list

npm config ls -l
```


```shell
# 当前目录下的包
npm list


# /usr/lib/node_modules/
npm list --global
```


* npmrc
